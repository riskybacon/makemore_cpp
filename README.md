📚 Overview

This is a C++ implementation of [makemore](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore) for educational purposes.
The project's only requirement is a compiler with C++20 support. No separate libraries are needed.

The project provides a simplified implementation of common ML components, allowing users to understand the core concepts of ML models, operations, and training loops. It’s ideal for anyone looking to learn the fundamentals of how ML frameworks operate under the hood.

🚀 Features

Basic Operations: Matrix operations like addition, multiplication, transpose, and elementwise transformations.
Manual backward pass: no autograd
Simple: no external libraries, training code is 

🛠️ Build and run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/riskybacon/makemore_cpp.git
cd makemore_cpp
```

2. Build and run project:
```bash
make
./pt1_one_layer
```

🧪 Examples

Basic Operations: See common.hpp for matrix operations.
Single layer model: see pt1_one_layer.cpp for the single layer / bag of words model
